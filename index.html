			<h2>Places Visited</h2>
			<p>Though I've visited many times before, there are always new places to explore when I go. This time around I went to a few places. Here is a list:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Catarina</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Resort/ Day-Relaxation Spot where you can relax in cabanas on top of a hill where you can oversee a wide view of the ocean underneath surrounded by other neighboring resorts. Here you can relax in big hammocks and take a dive in the waters, where you have diving spots.</li><br>

					</li>
					<li>Chocoyero</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Nice tour on the different bird species native to Nicaragua followed up by a hike around the territory, which gives you an excellent view of the surorunding mountains and greenlife, as well as the animal inhabitants.</li><br>

				</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Granada</li>
					
				<ul>
					<li>Although I've visited before, I had never really taken the time to do the historical city justice. This city is surorunded by old-Spanish influenced monuments, where you can take tours of. This followed up with the always live and spirited Central Park plaza.</li><br>

			<h2>Activities</h2>
			<p>Although I have come here before to mostly spend it with family and to sightsee, I have never really indulged in the activities that native Nicaraguans take part of. On this trip I decided to walk about and visit the city's parks, where most of the city dwellers go to at night.</p>
			<p>Alongside my cousins, I also went to experience the nightlife, by going out to the clubs and getting some drinks. To my welcomed surprise, one of the clubs I went to actually give you a complimentary drink as you enter the club. Also, while the atmosphere is clublike, some of the clubs did give a sort of barlike feel to them, which was a plus for me.</p>
			
			<a name="Friends"></a>
			<h2>Friends</h2>
			<p>This really touches home with me, because throughout the years, no matter the distance, or time in between visits, I can always come back and expect to leave things where I left off and resume really strong connections with people that I have met.</p>
